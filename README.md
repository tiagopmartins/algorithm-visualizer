Firstly, you'll need Node.js and npm installed. Use your package manager to install Node.js and then use Node.js to install npm.

> git clone https://github.com/tiagopmartins/algorithm-visualizer.git

> cd <your_directory>

> npm install

> npm start

And that's it!

## Help

1. The first click selects the start square
2. The second click selects the end square
3. The third click enables the wall drawing (NO HOLDING THE BUTTON NEEDED)

## Additional Information

This was a fun project for me to learn more about React and Javascript. With this, no big optimizations were done, although there is room for that. Enjoy!
